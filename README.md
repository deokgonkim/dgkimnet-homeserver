# homeserver - Home IoT server

## Description

homeserver provides data visualization for home IoT devices.

Currently, only one device, Raspberry Pi, is connected to my home.
The device will send room temperature and humidity numbers,
and can turn-on/off AC or turn on/off TV via IR transmitter.

homeserver will draw charts with received temperature and humidity.

Chart data will be stored in relational database.
